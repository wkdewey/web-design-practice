						<h2>Aaron Irizarry</h2>
						<h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>
						
						<p>Workplace culture doesn&#8217;t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn&#8217;t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It&#8217;s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it&#8217;s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>
						
						<p>In Aaron&#8217;s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don&#8217;t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace&#8217;s culture. Once you&#8217;ve worked within a culture of design it&#8217;s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>

						<h2>Adam Connor</h2>
						<h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmmakers</h5>
						
						<p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It&#8217;s the filmmaker&#8217;s job to put this together. To do so they&#8217;ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.</p>
						
						<p>With this workshop, we&#8217;ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#8217;ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and story boards. We&#8217;ll consider why they&#8217;re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>

						<h2>Chris Mills</h2>
						<h5>Heavy Metal Coding</h5>
						
						<p>In this unconventional talk, Chris Mills will encourage you to pick up some drum sticks in addition to your laptop, and beat out a rhythm of learning &#8211; both of code and drum beats! You'll learn basic JavaScript and CSS, plus beginner&#8217;s heavy metal drum patterns. The two are a match made in heaven, as nothing is a better antidote to code frustration than beating seven shades of **** out of a drum kit.</p>
